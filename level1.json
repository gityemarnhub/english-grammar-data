      "explanation": "Nouns are words that name people, places, things, or ideas. They are fundamental building blocks of sentences, providing the subjects and objects of our thoughts and discussions.  Nouns can be classified in several ways:\n\n* **Common nouns** refer to general categories (e.g., city, dog, book).  They are not capitalized unless they begin a sentence.\n* **Proper nouns** refer to specific entities and are always capitalized (e.g., London, Fido, Harry Potter).\n* **Concrete nouns** are tangible things you can perceive with your senses (e.g., apple, car, desk).\n* **Abstract nouns** represent intangible concepts, feelings, or qualities (e.g., happiness, freedom, justice).\n* **Countable nouns** can be counted and have singular and plural forms (e.g., one apple, two apples; one car, many cars).\n* **Uncountable nouns** (also called mass nouns) cannot be counted and generally do not have a plural form (e.g., water, rice, information).  We use quantifiers like 'much' or 'little' with them, not numbers.\n\nNouns commonly function as the subject, object, or complement of a verb, and they can be modified by adjectives. They can also show possession (e.g., the *boy's* hat).",

      "explanation": "Pronouns are words that replace nouns or noun phrases in a sentence, avoiding unnecessary repetition and making sentences more concise and fluid.  They refer to someone or something already mentioned or implied. There are several types of pronouns:\n\n* **Personal pronouns** refer to specific people or things (e.g., I, you, he, she, it, we, they, me, him, her, us, them).  They can be subjective (I, you, he, etc.) or objective (me, you, him, etc.).\n* **Possessive pronouns** show ownership (e.g., my, your, his, her, its, our, their, mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs).\n* **Reflexive pronouns** refer back to the subject of the sentence (e.g., myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves).  They are used when the subject and object are the same.\n* **Intensive pronouns** are used to emphasize the noun or pronoun they refer to. (e.g., myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves).\n* **Demonstrative pronouns** point out specific people or things (e.g., this, that, these, those).\n* **Interrogative pronouns** are used to ask questions (e.g., who, whom, whose, what, which).\n* **Relative pronouns** introduce relative clauses, providing additional information about a noun (e.g., who, whom, whose, which, that).\n* **Indefinite pronouns** refer to unspecified people or things (e.g., some, any, no, every, all, few, many, one, each, other, none).\n* **Reciprocal pronouns** express mutual actions or relationships (e.g., each other, one another).",

      "explanation": "Verbs are words that express actions, occurrences, or states of being. They are the core of a sentence, indicating what the subject does or is.  There are several types of verbs:\n\n* **Action verbs** describe actions (e.g., run, jump, eat, write). They can be transitive (taking an object) or intransitive (not taking an object).\n* **Linking verbs** connect the subject to a noun or adjective that describes the subject (e.g., be, become, seem, appear).  They do not show action.\n* **Auxiliary verbs** (also called helping verbs) combine with main verbs to form verb phrases. They indicate tense, mood, or voice (e.g., be, have, do, can, will, should).\n* **Modal verbs** are a type of auxiliary verb that express possibility, necessity, permission, etc. (e.g., can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would).\n\nVerbs also have different forms (e.g., base form, past tense, past participle, present participle) to indicate tense (time) and aspect (how the action unfolds).  They also change form to agree with the subject (e.g., 'I run' vs. 'He runs').",
